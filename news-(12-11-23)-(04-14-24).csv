The Spirit of Plato. 1816. ‍ A series of new studies have indicated that science is becoming less disruptive and more derivative, and one study ties that trend to collaboration becoming international and remote. The study finds that “scientists in on-site teams are better placed to fuse knowledge and conceive the next breakthrough idea,” and that the possibility of disruptive research moves in the opposite direction as collaboration becomes more long-distance. To determine whether research is disruptive, researchers looked at how often research is cited by future research: for instance, the ground-breaking study on the structure of DNA in 1953 is among the top 1% of disruptive research. The researchers argue that “the post-pandemic shift towards remote work will probably favor incremental innovation at the expense of disruptive discoveries,” and that as a result, especially demanding tasks should be assigned to local teams to maximize impact. Above all, this study emphasizes an effect of globalism that is rarely discussed and has implications for our progress as humanity.

One of the city’s founding documents celebrates “traditional, European/Western beauty standards on which the civilized world, at its best points, has always found success,” according to The New York Times. Brown envisions the city centering around a “walkable urban maze woven together at the heart of the city – encouraging chance encounters and the delight of uncharted discovery.” Additionally, he plans for the city to be populated by three “persona groups”: muscular warriors to protect from threats; “very thin” priests who define the values; and merchants who bring in capitalists and professionals. In 2021, Praxis went through the first of two funding rounds, raising $4.2 million from investors including Pronomos Capital, backed by Peter Thiel. In their second funding round, they received investment from Paradigm, a venture capital firm known for its $125 million stake in Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX. Dryden Brown: “We're going to build a new city, on the Mediterranean focused on technology focused on building a community of people who want to build technology companies in a special economic zone that really facilitates that in one of the most beautiful places in the world.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/65792463618ff59bf02495f8_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20Jacob%27s%20Dream.%201780..jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12856437/NYU-dropout-27-raises-19M-build-new-futuristic-Mediterranean-city-called-Praxis-based-traditional-Western-beauty-standards-three-persona-groups-muscular-warriors-priests-portly-merchants.html,Hermès Heir Gives $11B to Gardener,"‍ Blake, Wm.

The invention was pioneered by a team at the University of Technology Sydney, with a translation accuracy score of about 40%. This tech could allow patients who have become mute due to a stroke or paralysis to communicate with loved ones. For example, one participant was asked to think: “Good afternoon! I hope you're doing well. I'll start with a cappuccino, please, with an extra shot of espresso.” A screen then showed the AI’s response: “Afternoon! You well? Cappuccino, Xtra shot. Espresso.” Lead researcher CT Lin: “This research represents a pioneering effort in translating raw EEG waves directly into language, marking a significant breakthrough in the field. It is the first to incorporate discrete encoding techniques in the brain-to-text translation process, introducing an innovative approach to neural decoding.

Rahmani applies to about fifteen jobs per week but has yet to secure a job. Other seniors interviewed by Bloomberg reported similar results, saying their internship prospects in previous years don’t align with their bad luck in the job market.

Today, however, the oil companies that supported the town’s economy and infrastructure in its early days have moved away, leaving the town in a gradual state of decline. Selina Pedi-Smith, a community developer in the region: “The smaller towns have been in steady decline since then.” In a mission to revitalize the city, Pedi-Smith reached out to the architecture school at Penn State. One of Penn State’s initiatives right now is to use concrete to 3D print sustainable, affordable housing, and Pedi-Smith saw that technology as the perfect approach to reviving Oil City. The school identified a plot of land in the city to be used as a case study in a class for how 3D-printed concrete homes could bolster the economy. Students were divided into groups, with each creating different designs, all focusing on community engagement and tourism. They presented their final designs to a jury of reviewers in December, and Pedi-Smith said she will take inspiration from each project as she continues her efforts to restore the city.

Speaking to The Sentinel, Cassidy said he destroyed the altar to “awaken Christians to the anti-Christian acts promoted by our government.” Cassidy: “The world may tell Christians to submissively accept the legitimization of Satan, but none of the founders would have considered government sanction of Satanic altars inside Capitol buildings as protected by the First Amendment.

Only 29% of that group said they prefer capitalism, despite that being the system closest to America’s. The remainder said they didn’t have a preference or weren’t sure. One 19-year-old girl told Business Insider: “Seeing corporate greed in the news every single day makes it understandable that we would want something better. I don't necessarily think that means socialism. I think that means making sure the system that we're working under is really doing its best to support as many people as possible.” Another member of Gen Z said: “A system that centers overproduction, overconsumption, and perpetual growth is not sustainable. From increasing oil development in the midst of a climate crisis to jacking up food and energy costs, there's only a matter of time before we collectively agree that this setup cannot persist.” It’s not difficult to see where they’re coming from. Housing is the least affordable it’s been in four decades; polls have consistently found a majority of Americans struggle with paying for healthcare; and college tuition is at an all-time high.

A Landing in Britain. 1776. ‍ Silicon Valley billionaires are backing a new investment fund launched today that aims to develop libertarian societies called “Network States.” The basic idea for these societies is that the West has irrevocably declined, starting with the birth of a Leviathan-esque state that disempowered visionaries with predatory banking, regulations, and an adversarial journalism class. The solution, therefore, is for these visionaries to reclaim power over these institutions, which will be accomplished through the Internet and digital currencies like Bitcoin. Billionaires supporting this idea include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Peter Thiel, and venture capitalist Fred Wilson. These societies will initially emerge online and be based on “Internet values” like open source and peer-to-peer, but the hope is that they become communities in the real world and even create new cities, with institutions run by private companies. Examples of these communities that already exist include a car-free community in Tempe, Arizona, and the Peter Thiel-backed Próspera in Honduras. Balaji Srinivasa, an investor who launched the fund today: “Suppose you found a new startup society like Culdesac on the basis of car-free living…which is an innovation in parallel transportation.

The declaration from Jerusalem comes as the U.S. continues to offer unwavering support to Israel, providing weapons shipments and diplomatic support. Biden has routinely denied requests from his party and White House staff to call for a ceasefire. Biden, today: “I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives. Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.” The prime minister of Palestine, Mohammed Shtayyeh, said it’s far past time for the U.S. to be more firm with Israel, as Biden appears to be more open to a two-state solution. Shtayyeh: “Now that the U.S. has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk.” International humanitarian groups have pleaded for an end to the crisis, citing alleged war crimes like Israeli forces destroying homes, using white phosphorous supplied by the U.S., and ripping women and children from schools and murdering them execution-style.

It feels like reality has shifted.” “My mom put her trust in Dr. Berger as a medical professional during one of the most vulnerable times in her life.

Hadar Susskind, president of Americans for Peace, says these settlers draw inspiration from two Americans known as the godfathers of violence against Palestinians. The first is Baruch Goldstein, a doctor from Brooklyn, who murdered 29 Muslim worshippers in the West Bank in 1994. Goldstein was a follower of the second inspiration, American Rabbi Meir Kahane, who founded the extremist Kach party that was banned in both Israel and the U.S. under anti-terrorism laws. Susskind: “Those people are the prophets of the settler movement.” “Earlier this year I led a trip to Israel and Palestine. We went to Hebron and stopped in Meir Kahane park where they have a shrine to Baruch Goldstein. His grave is there. It’s shocking that they have a public park named after an American whose party was declared so racist that it was not allowed to be in the Knesset, a person who espoused violence and hatred.

As a result, companies have started turning to batteries. And the key to successful battery systems lies under Earth. A growing number of companies have started using common rocks that connect directly to solar and wind, or electricity sourced through the grid. These systems turn captured energy into heat stored in the rocks. When users need power, the heat is converted into steam or electricity. Examples of this system include Brenmiller Energy, which uses crushed volcanic rock, while Antora Energy uses graphite, and Rondo uses bricks. Doron Brenmiller, chief business officer at Brenmiller Energy: “When selecting the material, a few things come into consideration. First, heat capacity. Then you have to think about other parameters like cost, the availability of the material, and what happens to the material over time. We use volcanic rocks because they have particularly good heat capacity, and they can be sourced quite easily.” Ry Storey-Fisher, Antora’s policy manager: “In our case, we use blocks of solid carbon. This is an earth-abundant material that’s produced in millions of tons a year… These blocks stay stable to extremely high temperatures, and we basically heat those up to thousands of degrees Celsius in an insulated container, like a shipping container-sized module.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/6578fef92b34c9cb18cc8ec6_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20The%20Sun%20at%20His%20Eastern%20Gate.%201816..jpg,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-green-battery-of-the-future-is-made-of-rocks,3 Banks Control $8T ETF Market,"‍ Blake, Wm.

Specifically, the children born during or just before the lockdowns are developing language skills at a slower rate, using fewer distinct words and less complex phrases. These children barely reached the 40th percentile in vocabulary and sentence complexity, compared to the other group of children scoring in the 50th percentile. Researchers attribute this difference to children having limited social experiences during lockdowns. Additionally, the lockdowns introduced new challenges, such as wearing masks, that hindered children’s ability to speak and hear other people.

The earnings of these workers made up 7% of all wages and salaries paid by employers this year, compared to just 2% in the 1980s. Pew Research Center notes that these boomers are also working more hours than in past decades, partly because there are now more “age-friendly” jobs that have more flexibility and less physical labor. This coincides with another striking trend: an increasing number of young workers, particularly young men, are dropping out of the workforce. According to U.S. data, 7.2 million men of prime working age have stopped working and aren’t seeking employment. It’s unclear what exactly is driving that trend, but if it accelerates, more older workers may have to remain in the workforce.

In her Urban Plan, she limits the height of new buildings to twelve stories to reduce the environmental toll. Key projects she has undertaken include improving pedestrian traffic, overseeing the creation of an app that monitors thermal comfort, and advancing the idea of a fifteen-minute city, of which she has been a key proponent. Hidalgo hopes to eliminate non-essential traffic from the Paris center before the 2024 Olympic Games. Hidalgo: “Working with a diverse group of public and private sector experts as well as engaged residents of Paris, we have been able to create a city that translates this vision into reality. Together, we’ve championed initiatives to enhance walkability, diminish reliance on automobiles, and fortify our commitment to fostering sustainable communities both within and beyond the city limits.

As of this afternoon, the Instagram platform aggressively checks for links to YEWS, and disables posting, sharing and liking features whenever one is found. This has the effect of suspending a user’s account until the offending URL has been deleted. On reflection, we are grateful to Mark Zuckerberg and Meta for this unintentional accolade.

They are understood by readers across the political spectrum as a guarantee of independent reporting and a willingness to defy establishment narratives and norms in order to serve readers faithfully, even at a cost to the outlet’s growth.

For years, the advice was that our patients needed to ‘eat less and move more.’ That does not work.” David Ludwig, Harvard professor: “Western culture has considered obesity a character problem. Obesity is simply a matter of eating less and moving more, and if you can’t do it, it’s a lack of character or discipline. When in reality, obesity is more about biology than behavior. We need to think about nutrition as we think about drugs.” The doctors celebrated weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, with Jastreboff saying that “we’re in an incredibly exciting time.” Goldman Sachs estimates that the anti-obesity medication market could reach $100 billion by 2030, more than 16 times its $6 billion value this year.

The researchers compared data on the contents of fruits and vegetables measured in 1940 and in 2019, finding that the amount of sodium, iron, copper, and magnesium have all significantly declined. There’s one major reason for this trend: the Green Revolution in farming, which began around the 1960s. During this time, crops started being cross-bred to produce high-yielding varieties like wheat and rice. While this led to more crops overall, the crops themselves had a lower relative mineral content. This revolution has now produced worldwide “micronutrient malnutrition.” For example, 42% of children under 5 and 40% of pregnant women suffer from a lack of vitamins, according to the World Health Organization.

Among physicians, the rate is even higher, with 76% finding God and 73% “confirming their belief in ongoing miracles in modern times.” Sergiu Klainerman, professor of mathematics at Princeton: “People think that science or mathematics are completely based on reason, but this is just wrong. A mathematical theorem is indeed presented as a long sequence of logical arguments but that is not the way mathematicians arrive at their truth. Every new, deep theorem starts with a leap of faith, followed by reasoned arguments and not the other way around.” Klainerman points to the likes of Galileo, Newton, and Copernicus, all of whom thought God “talked” to them “through numbers and equations.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/657f324d559409c5ed5c8bd7_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20Christ%20Appearing%20to%20the%20Apostles%20After%20the%20Resurrection.%201795..jpg,https://catholicherald.co.uk/are-young-scientists-changing-their-minds-about-god/,Tallest Hotel In Vegas Opens,"‍ Blake, Wm.

This is entirely changing how we design buildings and cities in the future. It will be less about the individual designs of the architects and more about contributing toward the quality of a city.” “That means what we have to leave behind is egotism.

The time these apes hadn’t seen these friends ranged from nine months to 26 years.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis: “Today, history was made in Colorado. For the first time since the 1940s, the howl of wolves will officially return to western Colorado. The shared efforts to reintroduce wolves are just getting started and wolves will rejoin a diverse ecosystem of Colorado wildlife.” Wolves had vanished from the state in the 1940s following widespread hunting, trapping, and poisoning. The reintroduction aims to aid the ecosystem, as the canines keep deer and elk populations in check and redistribute nutrients through the carcasses of their prey. If the new wolves kill any domestic animals, Colorado’s government will compensate ranchers up to $15,000 per animal.

According to current estimates, there are about 4.5 billion tons of uranium in the sea, in the form of dissolved uranyl ions. This energy source—essentially over a billion years worth of nuclear fuel—has been largely untapped due to extraction methods proving largely unsuccessful. To extract the uranium, the team has engineered a flexible cloth that is woven from carbon fibers and coated with a special treatment. The cloth provides tiny pockets that capture the uranium. In tests, 12.6 mg of uranium per gram of water were extracted over 24 days, a higher amount and faster rate than any previous extraction method.

The city, called Silica City, is envisioned as a model for the country’s future, featuring a residential area, a city center, and a research area called Innovation Village, which will be the hub of the city. It will accommodate 60,000 residents and integrate biophilic design, sustainable features, and AI, as well as health and well-being services. Sensors would be embedded throughout the different buildings and structures to facilitate the day-to-day operation of the city, as well as its maintenance. For example, they would monitor changes in traffic patterns so that traffic lights could adjust in real-time to weather events, congestion, and accidents. The plan will also include telehealth and remote sensing components so that medical care can be provided to citizens in their homes.

The Court issued a hold on the prohibition until January 4, allowing the former president to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Following the decision, the state’s GOP wrote on X: “We will withdraw from the Primary as a Party and convert to a pure caucus system if this is allowed to stand.” A caucus system counts votes by participants dividing themselves into groups for different candidates, usually in large rooms like school auditoriums. On the other hand, a primary system involves voters casting a traditional ballot, with names already listed (although voters can write in candidates not listed).

In November, Ramiro Rosário passed the country’s first law written by AI. The law itself was boring, related to water regulations, but it was designed to easily pass, and it did—unanimously. Rosário points out that the drafting of the law would have taken a six-person team several days, compared to less than a minute for AI. All of these officials would also have to be paid, adding expenses to the government’s budget, and there would always be the possibility of human error. Rosário, on replacing politicians: “There must be 20 or 30 of them—they probably won’t be needed in the future, well, to be honest, they’re already no longer needed.” Tech optimists like Rosário point to data that shows wide distrust in the government.

A federal appeals court is simultaneously racing to consider the issue, but Smith hoped to skip right to the Supreme Court. Once the appeals court gets to the issue, it could send the matter back to the nine justices in early 2024. Because Trump is the first former president in American history to face criminal charges, the issue of immunity remains unclear.

Lucid dreams occur when a person essentially wakes up in their own dream and is aware enough to control parts of the dream. These dreams have been found to help with PTSD, reduce anxiety, and improve mood, confidence, motor skills, and creativity—yet half of adults say they have only experienced them once in their lifetime. This envisioned technology would work by detecting “when dreamers are in REM to induce and stabilize lucid dreams” with a device called Halo slated for a 2025 release. To research this project, Prophetic has partnered with a university in the Netherlands to generate the largest dataset of electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations of lucid dreamers. Nico Adelhofer, researcher: “Ideally, the user would not notice the device at all, but would see effects only in slight changes in dream experiences that appear natural and non-artificial.

The study, published in Science of the Total Environment, found longer telomeres in residents of greener areas.

Aaron Hipp, a professor of parks at North Carolina State and a co-author of the study: “Research is now showing that where we live, what we are exposed to, how much we exercise, what we eat, each of these can impact the speed of telomeres degrading and again our aging process.

St. Paul Preaching in Athens. 1780. ‍ California Governor Gavin Newsom called the efforts to remove Trump from the California ballot “a political distraction,” saying that “in California, we defeat candidates at the polls.” His comments come after his lieutenant governor sent a letter to California’s secretary of state on Wednesday requesting options be explored to ban Trump from the state’s presidential ballot. The effort was launched following the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision on Tuesday that Trump is ineligible to run for president because he incited “insurrection” on January 6, 2021, and thus is prohibited from appearing on Colorado’s ballot. Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis wrote to California’s secretary of state that “California must stand on the right side of history,” adding: “The constitution is clear: you must be 35 years old and not be an insurrectionist.” Newsom’s remarks embody what many see as his ongoing attempt to appear level-headed to the rest of the country. He’s appeared on Fox News on several occasions this year, suggesting an effort to appeal to conservative voters, perhaps in anticipation of a presidential run in the future.

Œconomy and Self Denial are Necessary. 1791. ‍ Church leaders in Bethlehem, the Palestinian city where Jesus Christ was born, have decided to cancel Christmas celebrations this year due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Typically, the historical city is packed with more than three million visitors to celebrate the birth of Christ, replete with celebrations of singers and dangers and fireworks, illuminated by a beautiful tree in the center of the town square. This year, the streets are dark and hushed. Pastor Munther Isaac told Christianity Today that “nobody was going to celebrate. Nobody is in a mood to celebrate,” because the locals are so horrified by what they say is a genocide committed by Israel in Gaza. However, Christian leaders in Bethlehem will still praise Christ on Christmas. They say the cancelation of spectacular celebrations will help them focus on the true meaning of Christmas. Elias Al-Najjar, a youth ministry leader, told a group of children and teenagers: “All these small details that we don’t usually think about. On Christmas, we usually put up decorations and have fun with Christmas trees and lights. But if you look at the real story of Christmas, it was a story of pure hardship.

The pill, called Vibes, works by vibrating in the stomach for 30 minutes before a meal, triggering stretch receptors that simulate the presence of food. This stimulation sends signals to the brain's hypothalamus via the vagus nerve, altering hormone levels to create a feeling of fullness and decrease hunger. In tests with pigs, the pill led to a nearly 40% decrease in food consumption. The researchers envision the pill as a non-invasive, temporary therapy for weight management. Unlike drug-based weight loss methods, the Vibes pill avoids significant side effects and offers a new avenue for non-surgical weight management.

Carlson noted that in the 2016 presidential election, Assange “upended” the race by publishing internal emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). These emails revealed that Hillary Clinton had rigged the primaries against her opponent, Bernie Sanders. For instance, in one May 2016 email, DNC National Secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote: “Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.” Democrats claimed the Russian government hacked the emails and then supplied them to Assange, which Carlson said is “a lie.” “The emails had been leaked from within the DNC itself, almost certainly by a disgruntled employee,” Carlson emphasized. Carlson is likely referring to Seth Rich, an employee of the DNC who was shot twice in the back in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood in July 2016. Assange has hinted in interviews that Rich was the source of the emails. Rich’s murder was peculiar for several reasons. Police described it as a robbery despite no valuables having been taken, the perpetrators were never apprehended, and the FBI ordered to disclose the information on his work laptop and personal laptop following his death.

Sources familiar with the phone call told The Wall Street Journal that Israeli warplanes were in the air and ready to go when Biden called on October 11 and pleaded with Netanyahu to consider the consequences of the action. Israel officials saw the strike as a preemptive attack against the Lebanese group, which they feared would attack Israel in the footsteps of Hamas. Since then, the U.S. has been actively working to de-escalate the conflict, including positioning military assets in the eastern Mediterranean and engaging in diplomatic efforts. Still, Biden has yet to call for a ceasefire. Since October 7, Israel has killed over 20,000 Palestinians. Hamas media claims 8,000 children have been killed.

The Vision of Christ. 1821. ‍ Researchers at Johns Hopkins have figured out that surgeons can learn skills in virtual reality and transfer them to real life—so long as they are zapped in the head with gentle, non-invasive electrical stimulation. Nowadays, surgeons are likely to learn certain skills in a virtual reality environment. One of the challenges with this new technology, however, is carrying the skills from a virtual environment to real life. In a study with 36 participants, those receiving the electrical stimulation demonstrated significantly better skill transfer from virtual to real environments, especially for complex and quick tasks. Scientists say this happens because stimulation depolarizes the neurons, which means neurons can communicate with each other better, facilitating the flow of information within the brain. The potential of this technology extends beyond surgical training, possibly revolutionizing skill learning in various industries and reducing training time and costs. Guido Caccianiga, the study’s lead author: “The group that didn’t receive stimulation struggled a bit more to apply the skills they learned in virtual reality to the actual robot, especially the most complex moves involving quick motions. The groups that received brain stimulation were better at those tasks.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/6583b2ed4bf4368987255790_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20The%20Vision%20of%20Christ.%201821..jpg,https://newatlas.com/medical/transcranial-electrical-stimulation-cerebellum-training-skill-acquisition/,Some Animals Are Turning Nocturnal,"‍ Blake, Wm. Hecate, or The Night of Enitharmon's Joy, object 12. 1795. ‍ As temperatures rise around the world, some species have been observed to have become more nocturnal to avoid the midday heat, raising concerns about potential impacts on the food chain. For instance, researchers have observed that white-lipped peccaries in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, typically active during the day, have shifted their activity to cooler mornings and eventually after sunset as temperatures rose above 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Similar behavioral changes have been observed in other species, like giant anteaters and cheetahs, indicating a broader trend of nocturnal adaptation among animals. Scientists warn that while night activity helps avoid the heat, it exposes animals to new risks, like increased predation and difficulties in food finding.

As AI technology advances, the virtual beings are becoming increasingly lifelike, mastering human interactions and emotions, and offering a level of perfection that real relationships can't compete with. Liberty Vittert, professor of data science: “They look like real people and are shockingly good when it comes to replicating human interactions. Physical AI robots that can satisfy humans emotionally and sexually will become a stark reality in less than ten years. It’s always this perfect relationship for lonely single men, which is very dangerous because it further isolates them from real human connections.” Analysts note that the emergence of AI girlfriends comes as birthrates are at a historical low and loneliness is already at an all-time high.

You live in this social realm, using it as a social crutch instead of making true connections.” Alvarez has hired a “party coach” who meets with her biweekly, assigning her podcasts, instructing her to journal, and teaching her how to discover new outlets to have fun. Evan Cudworth, 37, party coach: “So many people are retreating into their phones, into anxiety. I’m helping people rediscover what fun means to them.” The editorial blames several factors for this lack of fun plaguing Americans. A culture that prioritizes efficiency, productivity, and prestige over leisure; technological advances that capture our attention and expose our insecurities; and an increased sense of dreariness in the workplace, driven by heightened individualism and decreased trust for each other. Todd Davis, 66, corporate fun coach: “We go to work and there’s no sense of connection and camaraderie. People feel emotionally disconnected. Healthy conversations are the precursor of fun.

Suzanne Scholte, chairwoman of the NKFC: “We should be doing everything we can to get information into North Korea by land, by sea, and by air. Operation Truth is modeled after the Berlin Airlift, to get critical help to the starving people of North Korea.” Scholte’s Christmas message included in the bottles says: “Christmas, which is celebrated all over the world on December 25th, marks the day when Jesus was born...Many of your ancestors also believed in Jesus. In fact, in 1907, in Pyongyang, there were so many Christians who believed in Jesus that Pyongyang became known as a Holy City. But when Kim II Sung came to power, he wanted North Koreans to worship him as a god, and not the one true God. So, he killed many Christian leaders, sent others to political prison camps, or banished them.

The most striking part of these robots: they’re made using human lung cells. The discovery came when the scientists were tinkering with cilia, small hair-like structures on cell surfaces, and noticed they began moving when they faced outwards—so they applied that principle to create moving robots from lung cells. When these robots were placed on damaged neuron cells, new cell growth was encouraged. The scientists aren’t quite sure how cell regeneration will work, but they believe the robots could clear blocked arteries, repair spinal cords, identify cancer cells, or deliver drugs to specific parts of the body. They come in various sizes, with some as small as the width of a human hair.

The largest increases in expected holiday spending are among middle-income households and younger adults, with middle-aged adults planning the highest expenditure.

Carlson titled the seven-minute interview “a Christmas Eve election surprise,” with many wondering if the bit was to simply troll the Internet or if it was meant to convey a deeper, subtle message. Spacey was the target of nine charges of sexual impropriety, including seven counts of sexual assault, until he was acquitted of all of them in July. At one point in the interview, Carlson asks Spacey, who has lost all associations with Netflix, how he feels about the streaming giant using the sound of Frank Underwood knocking on wood as its intro sound when someone opens the app. Spacey: “It is bizarre they decided to publicly cut ties with me on allegations alone, allegations that have now been proven false. Because I don’t think there’s any question. Netflix exists because of me.

Khosla: “I do think in ten years we'll have free doctors, free tutors for everybody, and free lawyers so they can access the legal system. I also forecast in 25 years we will have a billion bipedal robots. That will create a massive industry larger than today's auto industry. My bet is we'll have more than a million in less than ten years.” Khosla emphasized that humans should not be scared of AI and should instead view the technology as a necessary step for progress: “Too many people are looking at the dystopian angle of this 1% probability of something bad happening and ignoring the benefits to humanity of AI. This large transformation is the opportunity to free humanity from the need to work. People will work when they want to work on what they want to work on.” Khosla’s sentiment aligns with a growing movement in Silicon Valley called effective accelerationism, which argues technological progress must be front and center to benefit humanity, regardless of the short-term harm it may do to aspects of society, like employment.

The final draft of the legislation stated: “The right of people to a dignified death is recognized in end-of-life decisions, which may include the limitation of therapeutic effort, continuous or palliative care, and valid procedures that end life.” Notably, the law was quietly passed—there was barely a mention in Cuba’s state-run media and no public debate. The decision has sparked a wider conversation about end-of-life choices in a predominantly Catholic country, with the Cuban Roman Catholic Church yet to comment. Suaima Lopez, nurse: “Families want to keep loved ones alive until the very, very last moment but one has to think of those suffering. If only we could have a dignified death ... let me die peacefully, in peace and harmony.” Euthanasia is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany, New Zealand, and some states in the U.S. It’s especially popular in Canada, making up 7% of all deaths in Quebec.

The move was largely driven by plummeting investment banking fees and the need to protect profit margins. The largest cuts came from UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse, leading to at least 13,000 fewer roles. Other major banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, contributed to the 30,000 additional layoffs. These reductions, affecting less than 5% of the total workforce for most banks, came after a pause due to COVID. Some banks like HSBC and Commerzbank avoided layoffs in 2023, while others like UK's Metro Bank planned to cut a fifth of their workforce. The outlook for 2024 remains pessimistic, with expectations of continued conservative hiring strategies amid a decline in investment banking activities and a cautious approach to dealmaking.

According to Beer Marketer’s Insights, sales declined by more than 5% in the first nine months of the year, dragged down by boycotts of Bud Light and the changing habits of younger drinkers. Bud Light faced backlash from conservatives following its collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The brand’s sales have steadily declined each month by 25% to 30% since the collaboration in April, unseating Bud Light as the top-selling beer in the U.S. after two decades. Other beers, such as Modelo, Coors Light, and Miller Lite, captured some of Bud Light’s lost market share, but their upticks weren’t enough to account for Bud Light’s decline. Overall, beer sales have been hit as younger Americans have increasingly replaced beer with other alcoholic beverages like canned cocktails or stopped drinking entirely. A study published last year found that teens in 2022 drank far less or were sober more often throughout their high school years than teens in 1999 to 2001.

While independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West are unlikely to win the White House, they could chip away at Democrats who sympathize with a left-wing economic message but have grown unsatisfied with Biden’s performance as president, especially regarding his handling of the Israel conflict. Notably, West’s plan includes appealing to Muslim voters in the swing state of Michigan, a key demographic to Biden’s victory in 2020. Losing just a fraction of these voters could scramble the election in 2024. One Democratic strategist told NBC News: “I think folks just aren’t fully dialed in yet to how serious this risk is. It’s a big deal. If you look at the risk that this poses, there will be no choice but to forcefully and strongly push back on it.” In September, reports emerged that Hillary Clinton told Biden to take the third-party threat seriously, with a source close to the conversation telling NBC News: “It’s pretty fucking concerning.” Tony Lyons, a Kennedy surrogate, points to a poll that finds 60% of voters would support a third-party candidate: “This is a pretty unique historical moment when more than 60% of the population says they’re open to voting for a third-party or independent candidate.” Meanwhile, the Republican side appears to not be as worried, with Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita emphasizing, “All of the elements of the third-party run are coming out of [Biden’s] coalition, not ours.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/6588f6164ba1641a3cbcc069_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20Raphael%20Warns%20Adam%20and%20Eve.%201807..jpg,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/2024-wild-card-banner-year-third-party-candidates-rcna129937,​​‍Study: Toxins In 40% Of Baby Food,"‍ Blake, Wm.

Finland, which borders Russia and maintained a neutral status for decades, joined NATO in April. The move was prompted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and doubled the length of the border that NATO shares with Russia. At the time, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Putin was opposed to NATO expanding eastward, with the Russian leader citing it as a justification for his actions in Ukraine. Stoltenberg said that Putin “is getting exactly the opposite... Finland today, and soon also Sweden will become a full-fledged member of the alliance.” Russian diplomat Mikhail Ulyanov on Thursday: “They had lived calmly and in peace and suddenly ended up between Russia and NATO as a member of that alliance, but since they are our neighbors, if, God forbid there is some escalation, they will be the first to suffer.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/657e26bef3b559aad3681089_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20The%20Wrath%20of%20Elihu.%201805.%20copy.jpg,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finland-will-be-first-suffer-if-russia-nato-tensions-escalate-russian-diplomat-2023-12-28/,Netflix Rivals Lost $5B This Year,"‍ Blake, Wm.

The Christian Association of Nigeria condemned the attacks, with its president, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, saying in a statement: “We condemn these acts of violence in the strongest possible terms. The burning down of houses, and worship centers, and the destruction of properties worth millions of naira is not only a criminal act but also a direct assault on our shared values of peace, unity, and mutual respect.” A Catholic organization called Intersociety said the massacre “was likely a clandestine government-coordinated revenge killing using the government-protected Fulani Jihadists to launch a reprisal attack over the December 3 killing of over 120 defenseless Islamic festival celebrants in Tudun Biri part of Kaduna State.” Intersociety was referencing the 120 Muslims who were killed by two airstrikes coordinated by the Nigerian Armed Forces. The military said it was an accident. Experts say Nigeria has more Christian martyrs than anywhere else on Earth. Of the 5,500 Christians killed last year, 90% were Nigerian, with estimates that 4,500 Christian Nigerians have been murdered this year.

Lawmakers passed the measure to protect minors, citing research that found over half of teens report seeing online porn by age 13. In a message to users in North Carolina, Pornhub says on its site: “Mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we’ve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place.” Pornhub added that it supports laws that require age verification on devices, not on individual websites.

Texas lawmakers say it was passed in response to a weak national response to immigration that has produced the greatest migrant crisis in modern American history. The Department of Justice wrote in a letter to Governor Abbott: “Because SB 4 is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government's operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement.” The DOJ emphasized that the law would undermine relations with Mexico and prevent federal officials from enforcing national immigration laws.

In November, she was censured by Congress for posting a video online that included the slogan “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which pro-Israel activists say is a call for the destruction of the Jewish state. Tlaib said she considers it “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.” Later that month, a Democrat in Michigan, the state Tlaib represents, said he was offered $20 million to run against Tlaib in the upcoming Democrat primary.

The country’s GDP share is set to decline from 18.4% in 2021 to 17% in 2023, a historic decline of 1.4 percentage points. Key reasons for this shift include increased government intervention, debt issues, slowed productivity, and declining foreign investment. Net foreign investment in China-listed shares this year has dropped 87%, or about $29 billion, meaning this year could mark the smallest year of foreign inflows since 2015. Investors largely pulled their money because of fears surrounding China’s slowed economy, which has failed to sustain its rebound since COVID amid a crumbling real estate sector, massive debts, and falling consumer demand.

The products in dispute include Reese's seasonal shapes like pumpkins, ghosts, bats, and snowmen. Cynthia Kelly says the actual chocolates don't include details like mouths and eyes that the packaging shows. The lawsuit reads: “Hershey’s labels for the Products are materially misleading and numerous consumers have been tricked and misled by the pictures on the Products’ packaging. Reese’s, what are you doing? Look at the picture on the packet. It’s like a pumpkin with faces and a little mouth—then you open up the packet and you are presented with that monstrosity.” Kelly's lawsuit also includes links to YouTube videos where others criticize Hershey's for similar reasons.

Critics like the Council of Artists Supporting Thai Buddhism argued the statue encouraged “un-Buddhist and scary” practices, including the sacrifice of animals.

Some worshippers also reportedly regarded him as a god of wealth. The hotel’s operator has been ordered to pay a fine of 1.3 million baht ($37,800).

It is a stark reminder to the world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin's objective remains unchanged. He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped.” “The stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. They affect the entirety of the NATO alliance, the security of Europe, and the future of the transatlantic relationship.

Dante in the Empyrean Drinking at the River of Light. 1824. ‍ Dubai is using new technology to enhance rainfall and augment water sources, addressing a growing need in its desert environment as its population surges. The technology, cloud seeding, involves adding chemical compounds, like silver iodide, into clouds to induce rain. The chemical particles are spread via plane or drone into supercooled clouds that are below the freezing point of water, functioning as a surface around which water droplets can form. As more water droplets condense around this surface, they begin to form ice crystals. These crystals start to grow quickly as the surrounding water vapor latches onto the crystals, producing snowflakes and descending as rain from the clouds. This method dates back to the 1940s and saw extensive use during the 1990s. Dubai's population has surged from less than a million in 2002 to over 3.5 million in 2022, intensifying the need for water in its dry environment.

The material’s possibilities range from producing super-strong screens for smartphones to being used in soft, glowing light fixtures and color-changing windows. To create transparent wood, scientists first need to modify or get rid of the glue, called lignin, that holds the cell bundles together and provides trunks and branches with most of their earthy brown hues. After removing the brown hue, a milky-white skeleton of hollow cells remains. Scientists then fill the air pockets with a substance like epoxy resin that bends light to render the wood transparent. Researchers emphasize that the resulting tiny wood fibers are stronger than the best carbon fibers, even outperforming plastic and glass. In experiments, transparent wood came out around three times stronger than transparent plastics like Plexiglass and about ten times tougher than glass. The findings suggest that transparent wood could even be helpful in energy-efficient buildings, aiding in temperature control better than traditional glass.

Scientists emphasize this is the closest a probe has ever been to the Sun, and in intergalactic terms, it will essentially “touch” it. The probe, which will also be the fastest-ever object made by humans, aims to study the solar corona, revealing the secrets of superheating and solar wind acceleration. Researchers say this is crucial for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth, and to prepare for future crewed missions to the Moon. Enduring temperatures up to 1,400°C (2,552°F), the probe will use a heat shield for protection during its close encounter, providing unprecedented data from within the corona.

The wave responses showed that the babies heard the beat when the time interval between the beats was always the same. These findings demonstrate “that being able to hear the beat is innate and not simply the result of learned sound sequences,” researcher István Winkler concluded.

Mary at Her Distaff Watched Over by Two Angels, object 4. 1816. ‍ A landlord in New Orleans has gifted tenants one month of free rent, with one resident calling the generosity “better than Santa Claus.” Britni Ricard owns an apartment building with ten units, with many of the tenants being single women with children. She says the women reminded her of growing up in public housing when she was a child, and how difficult affording Christmas presents was for her mom. Ricard: “It was tough. My mom was a single woman raising three children alone, and watching her continuously struggle as a child and wanting to figure out, 'How can I help?'"" In November, Ricard gathered her tenants for a pre-holiday meeting and gave them the good news: they wouldn’t have to pay for rent for a month. Kedesha Dunn, who lives in one of the units with her two boys, said the gift would allow her family to celebrate Christmas to the fullest. Dunn: “I'm an emotional person. I start to cry. 'Cause I'm just like, that is so sweet. She's uh, better than Santa Claus at this point. ... Like a guardian angel.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/6591ed78bb045ff208fbca38_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20Mary%20at%20Her%20Distaff%20Watched%20Over%20by%20Two%20Angels%2C%20Object%204.%201816..jpg,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/britni-ricard-free-rent-new-orleans/,Pornstar Wants Neuralink First,"‍ Blake, Wm.

Kayla Kayden has described Neuralink as “botox for the brain,” saying she wants to be the first recipient so she can be a “hybrid human.” Kayden, speaking with NudePR.com: “People use botox for their face, this would be the same but for the brain. I won’t have to worry about the effects of aging on my brain. As a hybrid human, the possibilities are endless.” She emphasized she has very valid reasons for getting the implant: “I have very bad vision. I’ve been in glasses/contacts since I was very young. I am legally blind, I’m -6.5 with astigmatism.” The comments come after Kayla previously made headlines after getting an instant 24-hour boob job with saltwater injections.

But there were also ones that made everyone pause for a moment and ask: “What?” Here are a few of those. Mexican aliens: A ufologist presented to Mexico’s Congress what he said were corpses of real-life aliens. He announced that the bodies were more than 1,000 years old and were discovered buried between the Peruvian cities of Palpa and Nazca in 2017. Scientists are now studying these bodies, claiming they had “eggs” inside of them. TikTok’s NPC trend: TikTok users started live-streaming themselves acting like video game NPCs. For hours on end, they repeated lines of dialogue, pretended to eat food, and interacted with users as if they were in a video game. Some of these streamers made thousands of dollars a day. “That person is not real”: A female airline passenger was filmed emotionally trying to leave a plane, saying a man sitting next to her resembled a lizard. The woman, identified later as Tiffany Gomas, has since apologized for her public outburst, refusing to say what caused it. She now appears on podcasts and gives business advice.

The Vision of the Last Judgment. 1808. ‍ Viral videos of customers highlighting how expensive McDonald’s and other fast food joints have gotten have made it to the Biden administration. Now, the White House is developing a plan to combat what it says is “disinformation.” According to the White House, memes about McDonald’s meals reaching as high as $16 due to inflation is “one of their most vexing challenges ahead of the 2024 presidential election,” reports The Washington Post. The plan to combat this “disinformation” remains unclear, but TikTok will likely be in the spotlight, as that is where most of this content is spreading. Some economists think this content is “dangerous” because it affects polling, as seen in Biden’s declining economic approval. The Washington Post: “These economists fear that these exaggerated stories will ultimately lead to a worse outcome — perhaps helping Trump win reelection — and that it is vital to make clear that this remains by many measures one of the best recoveries in modern U.S. history.” ",https://assets-global.website-files.com/6500bdee3b9e070412a101f7/658652864eec6dba61a3bac4_Blake%2C%20Wm.%20The%20Vision%20of%20the%20Last%20Judgment.%201808..jpg,https://archive.is/uMbxo,Woman Wears Painted Leggings To Gym,"‍ Blake, Wm.

In the video, one man in the gym confronted her, saying: “If you don't have clothes on, you need to be out of here.” Users online largely defended the man and criticized the woman. One user on X wrote: “Imagine thinking even one person was about to be on your side.” Another added: “And the guy is right.

The compound was already known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and the study further found that those over 60 years old who consume wasabi showed significant improvement in their episodic and working memories compared to the placebo group. Improvements were especially visible in the ability to process short conversations, execute simple calculations, and correspond names with faces.
